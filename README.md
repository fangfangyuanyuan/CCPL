# CCPL

The CCPL model mainly includes CCPG and CMF modules. Among them, the CCPG module strengthens the interaction between visual prompt and text prompt, and improves the ability of both to capture each other's key information and integrate it into their features. The CMF module strengthens the fusion of image features and text features, and effectively maintains the semantic consistency of image and text. The experimental results show that our CCPL achieves the best comprehensive performance in few-shot image classification learning. Through ablation experiments, we analyze the contribution of CCPG and CMF modules.
